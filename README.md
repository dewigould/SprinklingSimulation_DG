# Sprinkling Simulations
Causal set sprinkling for testing of analytic integration results


This script contains code for Poisson sprinkling into (1+1) and (2+1) dimensional Minkowksi spacetimes. In the (2+1) dimensional case, two set-ups are considered: a full conical horizon and an approximation to that case with a planar horizon.
